		<h1>Choose the Perfect Type for you...</h1>
	</div>
    <div class="main_para">
        <p>When choosing the perfect kind of bicycle for yourself, it is very important to understand that you should know what you are looking for. When you walk into a bike shop, you are probably going to be asked first what type of bicycle you want, be it a road bike, mountain bike, or a hybrid bike.

            Your decision entirely rests upon your biking needs and personal preferences. Some people look for speed control, some love doing tricks while many others take part in bike races.
            
            So, in order to pick the best bicycle for yourself, you must ask yourself how often you plan to ride, how much you are willing to invest and what exactly will you use your bike for. For that, however, you must be aware of the different types and kinds of bicycles that are available today, each with unique styles, features and form.
            
            Here is a comprehensive list of all the possible types of bicycles that you can get for yourself.</p>

            <p>Road bikes are best identified by their drop or turned-down handlebars and skinny tires. The downward-curving handlebars are usually super lightweight that help put you in an aerodynamic position. The lightweight frame makes this type of bicycle particularly good for numerous pavement uses including racing, touring, fitness riding, long-distance rides and daily commuting.</p>
            <p>The large, thin tires allow you to glide the bike along various terrains with zero to little effort. If you are supremely concerned about speed, varied options for hand and riding positions, and an efficient transference of energy into propelling the bike forward, a road bike is the best option for you.</p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>This bike is designed with excellent braking systems and shock-absorbing features that can easily handle serious bumps, rocks, dirt trails, roots and ruts.  Mountain bikes are meant for dealing with steeper terrain which is why most of them consist of lower gears as compared to most other road bikes.

                They usually have 26-inch or 29-inch wide knobby tires that make them function amazingly well over obstacles and in loose dirt. They also consist of rugged components and frames, flat handlebars and suspension in order to assist cyclists in navigating rocky mountain hills.</p>

            <p>I’m well acquainted with electric bicycles. I bought an electric mountain bike last summer and love it.

                They are growing in popularity, although I’m surprised they aren’t more popular.  Here’s the trend chart for 5 years:
                
                 
                
                These bikes include an electric motor which you can charge by plugging it into a regular outlet.  When you peddle, the electric motor provides an assist so that you go faster and hills are made easier.
                
                Many types of bicycles are available in electric versions including mountain bikes, road bikes and hybrid bikes (for commuting).
                
                I will probably never get a non-electric bike again.  You still get a great workout or can take it nice and easy.  Learn more about electric bikes here (based on my extensive use).
                
                Now that you are aware of the major types of bicycle available for you out there, which one are you going to buy for yourself? Regardless of whichever bicycle you choose, remember to pick one that you truly need and one that perfectly fits your cycling requirements.</p>

            <p>BMX is an acronym for Bicycle Motor Cross, primarily because this type of bicycle is a single-speed bike that is raced around short dirt tracks, quite similar in nature to the motor sport. The acronym is also often used describe any bike with single-speed and a 20-inch wheel.</p>
            <p>BMX bikes are ideal for people who intend to perform tricks and jumps with their bikes because they are especially built for that, with their robust and durable design and structure. They consist of small frames, a single gear and twenty inch wheels which means that they are not only strong but very low maintenance too as compared to an average bicycle.</p>
